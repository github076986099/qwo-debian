Quikwriting for OpenMoko

Original idea by Pr. Ken Perlin.
Author : Charles Clement <caratorn@gmail.com>

This project is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input
text for hand-held devices without picking your finger off the screen.
For information about QuikWriting, take a look at
http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/demos/quikwriting.html

To test the software on a desktop, simply choose the focus window before
beginning inputing text.

You can specify another font to use with the -f switch, for example:
#qwo -f "-*-courier-bold-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

The character > appear twice, the one in the upper left region is a modifier
and will change the case to uppercase for the next inputed character; extending
the gesture one region past its normal destination will lock the case to upper,
to return to normal issue the > again.

The left < and right > of the center area are, respectively, the delete and
space. You can delete the whole text buffer content by staying at least three
seconds on the region containing the delete action, doing the same on the space
will add a new line at the cursor position.

To exit the program enter eight regions excluding the one in the center. You can
start with the upper left one, go to the upper middle one ... Without going back
to the center and finally hitting the upper left one again.

It is possible to customize the layout by adding a configuration file in your
home directory named .qworc or with the command line switch -c <file_name>.  You
first need to install libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/).  An
example configuration file for a French layout is provided in data/qworc. You
can access these characters by issuing a normal gesture and instead of going
back to the center, go back to the first region entered.

The definitions for the letters are the ones defined in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
without the "XK_" prefix.
