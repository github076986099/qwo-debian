Quikwriting for OpenMoko

Author : Charles Clement <caratorn@gmail.com>

This project is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input
text for handheld devices without picking your finger off the screen.
For information about QuikWriting, take a look at
http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/demos/quikwriting.html

To test the software on a desktop you might want to configure it with the
destination window, by issuing:
./configure --enable-standalone
which will create a window containing the inputed text.

You can specify another font to use with the switch -f, for example:
qwo -f "-*-courier-bold-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

There is two < and > characters on the first character set, the upper ones are
modifiers and will change the character set for the next input. The left and
right ones of the center area are, respectively, the delete and space.

To exit the program enter eight regions excluding the center one. You can start
with the upper left one, go to the upper middle one ... without going back to
the center and finally hitting the upper left one again.
