Quikwriting for OpenMoko

Original idea by Pr. Ken Perlin.
Author : Charles Clement <caratorn@gmail.com>

This project is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input
text for hand-held devices without picking your finger off the screen.
For information about QuikWriting, take a look at
http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/demos/quikwriting.html

To test the software on a desktop you might want to configure it with the
destination window, by issuing:
#./configure --enable-standalone
which will add support window containing the inputed text.

You can specify another font to use with the -f switch, for example:
#qwo -f "-*-courier-bold-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

The currently character sets are the lowercase letters, uppercase and numbers.
To switch the current set click in the window.

The characters < and > appears twice, the upper ones are modifiers and will
change the character set for the next inputed character respectively to the
previous and the next set and go back to the current one. The left and right
ones of the center area are, respectively, the delete and space. You can delete
the whole text buffer content by staying at least three seconds on the region
containing the delete action, doing the same on the space will add a new line at
the cursor position.

To exit the program enter eight regions excluding the one in the center. You can
start with the upper left one, go to the upper middle one ... Without going back
to the center and finally hitting the upper left one again.
