Quikwriting for OpenMoko

Original idea by Pr. Ken Perlin.
Author : Charles Clement <caratorn@gmail.com>

This project is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input
text for hand-held devices almost without picking your finger off the screen.
For information about QuikWriting, take a look at

INSTALLATION:

You will need to install illume-config-illume to change the default keyboard on
the Freerunner. Deactivate Qtopia keyboard by adding the line:
export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1
in the file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia and restart the X server with:
/etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart
Then click on the wrench, keyboard configuration utility and select qwo.

Gestures are handled with key presses and thus should be strong enough.

Numbers are issued with a press on the corresponding region of a numeric keypad,
except for the 0, currently issued by entering the center region and releasing
in the one below.

The character > appears twice, the one in the upper left region is a modifier
and will change the case to uppercase for the next inputed character; extending
the gesture one region past its normal destination will lock the case to upper,
to return to normal issue the > again.

The left < and right > of the center area are, respectively, the delete and
space. You can delete the whole text buffer content by staying at least three
seconds on the region containing the delete action, doing the same on the space
will add a new line at the cursor position.

Other characters can be obtained without beginning and ending in the center, the
current keymap for these is:

-----------------------------------------
1   Tab         |   2 -|                3
/                                       \
-----------------------------------------
            |       up       |
4           |left   5   right|          6
down Control|       0        |      Enter
-----------------------------------------


7                |  7  _|               9
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to customize the layout by adding a configuration file in your
home directory named .qworc or with the command line switch -c <file_name>.  You
first need to install libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/).  An
example configuration file for a French layout is provided in data/qworc. You
can access these characters by issuing a normal gesture and instead of going
back to the center, go back to the first region entered.

You can specify another font to use with the -f switch, for example:
#qwo -f "-*-courier-bold-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

The definitions for the letters are the ones defined in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
without the "XK_" prefix.
