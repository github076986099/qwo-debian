Quikwriting for OpenMoko

Author : Charles Clement <caratorn@gmail.com>

This project is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input
text for hand-held devices without picking your finger off the screen.
For information about QuikWriting, take a look at
http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/demos/quikwriting.html

To test the software on a desktop you might want to configure it with the
destination window, by issuing:
#./configure --enable-standalone
which will add support window containing the inputed text.

You can specify another font to use with the -f switch, for example:
#qwo -f "-*-courier-bold-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

There is two < and > characters on the character sets, the upper ones are
modifiers and will change the character set for the next input respectively to
the previous and the next one. The left and right ones of the center area are,
respectively, the delete and space.

To exit the program enter eight regions excluding the one in the center. You can
start with the upper left one, go to the upper middle one ... Without going back
to the center and finally hitting the upper left one again.
